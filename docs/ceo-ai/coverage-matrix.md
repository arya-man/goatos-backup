# Leadership Assistant — Coverage Matrix (backfill baseline)

## Implementation Status

**2026-07-22**: Fixed critical readtools findings:
1. Deleted the broken projected-count call (wrong method signature; missing park + target date). Species now sourced from Cube.
2. Routed animal species counts (counts_breakdown) to Cube tier instead of API tier (Cube has correct active_animal_count metric).
3. Fixed error swallowing: toolexecutors now propagate reader errors instead of silently returning empty facts.
4. Vaccination/feed executors return errors when not wired, preventing silent empty results.
5. Added comprehensive toolexecutors_test.go with error-propagation + species-split assertions.
API tier routing now returns real data from the Mesha read APIs listed in section A below,
with errors properly surfaced for fallback orchestration.

One-time full sweep of every leadership-relevant table, read API, and feature in
the repo against the assistant's read path. Each row resolves to exactly one
coverage path — a **Cube** governed metric, a **`ceo_ai.*`** reporting view, an
**MCP Toolbox** tool, a mapped **Mesha read API**, or a **documented exclusion**.
This is the fully-covered baseline the `leadership-assistant-coverage-guard`
enforces forward from. When you add a feature, add its row here (or an exclusion)
in the same change. Draft = view/tool/metric designed here, implementation
tracked in `docs/ceo-ai/mcp-toolbox-plan.md`.

Legend: **Cube** governed metric · **view** = `ceo_ai.*` reporting view · **tool**
= MCP Toolbox curated tool · **api** = Mesha read API · **EXCLUDED** = documented
non-leadership surface.

## A. Read APIs

Source inventory: the read-API catalog the planner consumes. Leadership-relevant
APIs map to a tier; the rest are documented exclusions with a reason.

| Read API (path) | Coverage path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET /herd-register/summary | api + Cube:active_animals | Primary census; aggregate-first |
| GET /counts/breakdown | api + view:animal_current_scope | Grouped census drilldown |
| GET /app/counts/shifting-events/pending-execution | api + view:counts_movement_daily | Movement backlog |
| GET /app/counts/approvals | api + view:counts_movement_daily | Pending census approvals |
| GET /app/counts/shifting/destinations | EXCLUDED | Operator write-flow picker; not a leadership metric |
| GET /goats/search | EXCLUDED | Record-level lookup; leadership stays aggregate |
| GET /goats/{goat_id} | EXCLUDED | Single-animal detail |
| GET /goats/{goat_id}/passport | EXCLUDED | Per-animal history detail |
| GET /goats/{goat_id}/timeline | EXCLUDED | Per-animal audit trail |
| GET /identifiers/{type}/{value}/resolve | EXCLUDED | Scan-time resolution utility |
| GET /vaccination/execution | api + Cube:vaccination_due/overdue | Due/overdue by shed |
| GET /vaccination/execution/sheds/{shed_id} | api + view:vaccination_shed_status | Cause drilldown |
| GET /vaccination/operations | api + view:vaccination_shed_status | Cohort rollups |
| GET /vaccination/schedule | api + view:vaccination_operator_status | Operator-date drive workload from `vaccination_drive_assignments`; leadership assistant and admin-web summarize one operator/day row with animal cap, animal progress buckets, physical shed total chips, vaccines, total doses, and partition metadata only as local drawer drilldown context; drawer shed rows deep-link to the shed execution/goat roster view |
| POST /vaccination/schedule/drive-date-overrides | api + view:vaccination_operator_status | Admin vaccine-date move/revert. The write path must split or restore raw `vaccination_drive_assignments` membership for the moved vaccine; leadership assistant, MCP Toolbox/read API answers, and SQL fallback must report the regenerated operator-date rows, not stale mixed rows from the original date. |
| Vaccination schedule-source sync across Calendar/AC/PA/WF/execution/Android | api + view:vaccination_operator_status | Coverage clarification: no new assistant tool or KPI. Existing vaccination read API, MCP Toolbox, and `ceo_ai` coverage must prefer the effective `vaccination_drive_assignments` operator-day date before legacy batch/obligation/task due dates, so leadership answers match the same current schedule shown in admin-web and Android. |
| GET /vaccination/sheds | api + view:vaccination_shed_status | Shed status list |
| GET /vaccination/sheds/{shed_id} | api + view:vaccination_shed_status | Shed drilldown |

| GET /control-tower/vaccination | api + view:action_center_current | Leadership control tower |
| GET /app/vaccination/execution(+/sheds/…, roster, coverage, gaps, tasks/…) | EXCLUDED | Operator-scoped app views; leadership uses /vaccination/* |
| GET /calendar/vaccination/events | api | Calendar timeline (dots) |
| Calendar vaccination date markers | api | Leadership assistant read API coverage: month/week marker dots use the same assignment-effective schedule date as the calendar event list and vaccination operator schedule, so leadership answers and client overview counts do not report stale batch/obligation dates after a drive move. |
| GET /calendar/vaccination/events/{event_id}(+/history,/targets) | EXCLUDED | Single-event / target detail |

## B. `ceo_ai.*` reporting views

Every view maps its grain + columns to real sources. Columns with no backing
source are typed `NULL::type -- TODO` placeholders (never silently dropped) and
tracked as gaps below.

| View | Status | Column gaps (typed NULL + TODO) |
|---|---|---|
| animal_current_scope | draft | — (all mapped) |
| shed_capacity_current | draft | — |
| vaccination_shed_status | draft | planned_sessions (park-level batches → shed derivation approx) |
| vaccination_dose_pickup | draft | vaccine_label (needs display-label mapping — gap G2) |
| vaccination_operator_status | draft | — (operator-grain drive load/capacity/overdue/utilization over `vaccination_drive_assignments`; migration 000026) |
| feed_direction_current | draft | — (directive only; actuals → gap G7 feed_adherence) |
| counts_movement_daily | draft | transfers_out (derived from terminal exits — partial) |
| procurement_pipeline | draft | batch_label (no stored load label — gap) |
| source_entry_health_status | draft | load_label (no stored load label) |
| ops_exception_queue | draft | — (UNION across modules) |
| sop_execution_status | draft | — |
| verification_queue_status | draft | — |
| inventory_stock_position | draft | reorder_flag (no threshold config — gap G1), last_reconciled_at (partial) |
| workforce_coverage_status | draft | — |
| action_center_current | draft | — (UNION) |
| audit_activity_summary | draft | result (no outcome column — derive from jsonb, partial) |

## C. Leadership-relevant tables → covering view

| Table | Covered by |
|---|---|
| goats, herd_register_summary_projection | animal_current_scope, counts_movement_daily |
| locations, park_profiles, shed_profiles, location_capacity_records | shed_capacity_current |
| vaccination_eligibility_rollups, obligation_instances, obligation_batches, vaccination_completions | vaccination_shed_status, vaccination_dose_pickup |
| vaccination_drive_assignments (operator-based drive model) | vaccination_operator_status (operator load / capacity / overdue / utilization) |
| obligation_escalations | ops_exception_queue, action_center_current |
| feed_direction_issues, feed_direction_issue_rows | feed_direction_current, ops_exception_queue |
| feed_direction_completions | gap G7 (feed_adherence) |
| shifting_events, shifting_event_impacts, counts_approval_requests, count_projection_* | counts_movement_daily, ops_exception_queue |
| procurement_loads, procurement_load_goats, arrival_intake_reviews, procurement_source_health_checks, procurement_hf_vaccination_evidence | procurement_pipeline, source_entry_health_status |
| sop_tasks, sop_submissions | sop_execution_status |
| verification_items | verification_queue_status |
| inventory_items, inventory_stock, inventory_stock_movements | inventory_stock_position |
| workforce_members, workforce_positions, workforce_absences, workforce_roster_assignments, org_role_catalog | workforce_coverage_status |
| audit_log | audit_activity_summary |
| breeds, animal_stage_lookup, vaccines, parties, vaccination_capacity_config | reference/config — EXCLUDED (support tables, surfaced via joins, not standalone leadership reads) |

## D. Gaps to close (decisions)

Each gap has an explicit decision: draft a view/metric, or a documented
scoped-refusal exclusion so the bot says "not covered yet" rather than inventing.

| Id | Gap | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Inventory has no tier-2 read API; reorder threshold has no source | Draft `ceo_ai.inventory_stock_position` + MCP tool (tier-3); `reorder_flag` = typed NULL until a reorder-point config column exists. Document inventory as SQL/Toolbox-tier (no tier-2 API yet) in the routing contract |
| G2 | vaccine_label leaks raw codes | Add a shared vaccine display-label mapping (single source consumed by view + `ui-vaccine-labels` guard); guard test asserts no raw token (et_tt/ppr_booster/…) reaches an answer |
| G3 | No answer-grounding validator | Composer grounding validator: every number/label must map to a citation-backed tool result or be stripped/downgraded; first-class eval assertion |
| G4 | Bounded agent step loop not explicit | `backend/internal/ceoai/app/loop.go` honoring `MESHA_AI_MAX_STEPS` + per-step deadline + deterministic stop; eval asserts termination |
| G5 | mortality_rate KPI has no base view; DLQ/kernel-health surfaced only via ops queue | Draft `ceo_ai.mortality_base` + Cube `mortality_rate`; map DLQ/kernel-health into `ops_exception_queue` (done above) |
| G6 | Breeding/reproduction: columns exist, no read path | Scoped-refusal exclusion until a breeding workflow ships: bot answers "breeding pipeline not covered yet" (add refusal copy). Not a silent gap |
| G7 | Feed adherence (actuals vs directive) uncovered | Draft `ceo_ai.feed_adherence` joining directive rows to `feed_direction_completions` + a GenAI intent |
| G8 | Notification/escalation delivery health uncovered | CLOSED: `ceo_ai.notification_delivery_health` view built (migration 000020) + `mesha_notification_delivery_health` MCP Toolbox tool (tier-3) in the leadership toolset. No governed Cube metric — this is an operational delivery-reliability read served via Toolbox, not Cube |
| G9 | Scale certification of `ceo_ai.*` views | EXPLAIN-based query-plan proofs at ~500k-row seed wired into a `validate-ceo-views-plans` gate (planned; tracked in mcp-toolbox-plan) |
| G10 | Conversation thread titles unpopulated | Title-derivation on conversation create (planner summary or truncated first message) + rename path |
| G11 | Identity-resolution / data-quality backlog uncovered | Surface via `ops_exception_queue` (location-review + escalations); dedicated identity-conflict view deferred, documented here |
| G12 | Transit/holding, proof artifacts, device fleet | EXCLUDED for now: transit/holding deferred (draft when volume matters); proof artifacts surfaced via per-module "evidence present" derivation; device fleet is ops-admin telemetry, not a leadership KPI |
| G13 | API-tier tool executors (in-process adapters) | CLOSED: tier-2 in-process `ToolExecutor` adapters registered in `ceoai/adapters/readtools/` for planner-routed API tools (vaccination_shed_summary, vaccination_execution, feed_direction_today). Species counts routed to Cube tier (active_animal_count metric) instead of API. Executors propagate errors via `ToolResult.Err` instead of swallowing them; toolexecutors_test.go covers error-propagation + species-split assertions. Resolves `backend/internal/ceoai/app/registry.go:106` routing error + P0-critical error-swallowing bug. |

## E. Rule

Nothing may be leadership-relevant AND uncovered AND undocumented. A new
table/API/feature is incomplete until it appears in this matrix as a coverage
path or an explicit exclusion, and the `leadership-assistant-coverage-guard`
passes. Use `node tools/ceo-ai/scaffold-coverage.mjs <module>` to generate the
stubs and this row.
