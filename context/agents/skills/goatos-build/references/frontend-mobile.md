# Frontend And Mobile Reference

Load this when working on admin-web, dashboards, operator-mobile, UI reuse,
RBAC visibility, generated clients, offline sync, media capture, or app adapters.

Canonical docs:

- `context/frontend/final-frontend-mobile-backend-architecture.md`
- `context/execution/target-repo-structure.md`
- `context/execution/two-dev-build-plan.md`

Rules:

- Existing live dashboard repos are reference/source material and must stay untouched during Goat OS rewiring.
- Take fresh snapshots/clones into `goatos/apps/admin-web` and `goatos/apps/investor-web-shadow`; change only those copies.
- Keep useful UI/components, replace data path with Goat OS APIs/analytics APIs in the goatos copies.
- Current live dashboard URLs keep running until the new Goat OS dashboards validate against them.
- Operators use Android task/form app, not BI dashboards.
- App code depends on generated clients and adapters, not direct vendor SDK calls.
- No microfrontends until separate teams/release cadences justify them.
